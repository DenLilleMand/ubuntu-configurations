I had to install a few things in order to make vim work with go, as far as i understand the best 
user experience is with neovim nowadays, because they have some async jobs(mb vim 8 has that aswell now though) and 
thats awesome for talking with a server somewhere about syntax/autocompletion etc. 

So i aliased vim to nvim in my ~/.bashrc  alias vim='nvim'

Other than this, i had some trouble installing 4 essential plugins to make Go work seemlessly with vim. 

I had to install the vim plugin manager called vim-plug, in order to install 
the 4 plugins i need. It works alot like Vundle actually, the section i made for this 
plugin goes as follows:

" Vim-plug -------------------- {{{
call plug#begin('$HOME/.config/nvim/plugged')
    Plug 'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'
    Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
    Plug 'nsf/gocode', { 'rtp': 'nvim', 'do':'~/.config/nvim/plugged/gocode/nvim/symlink.sh' }
    Plug 'zchee/deoplete-go', {'do': 'make'}
call plug#end()
" }}}

And can see that in my dot file aswell. What i dont have documented anywhere though
is that i had to symlink ~/.config/nvim/autoload with ~/.config/nvim/plugged, i am sure
that its just because i followed different tutorials that used different conventions, can probably call it whatever i want. 

It is probably the easiest to follow the install documentation on these plugins webpage,
but you install vim-plug plugins with the command :PlugInstall, 
and if you have any errors in these repository names etc, it can complain about your github username, which isn't really the issue.
