!!! read the source, it has a option called --install-dircolors which is important!

$ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli
$ git clone https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
$ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
$ ./install.sh  

TO ENABLE DIRECTORY COLORS:

We also need another repository for the directory colors: https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized.git

when the repository is cloned, we can test out the different dir colors with the command:

eval `dircolors dircolors.ansi-light`

and in order to make it permanent copy whichever you like to the ~/.dircolors file,
as a notion - it appears as if we have support for both ansi and 256 colors

can change <dircolors.ansi-light> with whatever dircolors in the file
