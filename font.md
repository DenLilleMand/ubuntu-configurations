1. Go to: http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ 
2. Download the package + unzip/untar
3. Open each individual font with the distributions default font reader, in ubuntus case thats called 'Font Viewer' - which should give the option to install the font, then it should be applicable to the terminal + IDE's. Might have to reload the IDE


In terminal/vim i just use the Hack regular, but in phpstorm we're only given the Hack choice.
