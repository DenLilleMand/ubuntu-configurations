#Bad Thoughts:

It might become annoying with the *.swp files vim creates, e.g. 
if you try to open the same vim file in a different session. But, 
I guess the idea is that you have x1 session, and then just have multiple windows, that would get around this fact, and just be awesome infact.

#Good Thoughts:
Couple this with something like Skype or Discord and we have a 
really powerful collaborative tool. I think this could bring back the team feeling on projects, and bring a bit more of that intensity that we leak a little sitting at our own computers all the time.
