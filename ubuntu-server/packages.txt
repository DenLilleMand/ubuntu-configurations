packages:


1. thin: ruby server, used to serve redmine and surprising enough, its actually not easy at all to make this run without knowing how to, 
  http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/usage/  was a great help.. eventually i got the redmine.yml file in this directory to work, i never
  got the sockets to work, only the address:port which is perfect for nginx anyway. But the reason why thin didn't start redmine was because 
  i had a symlink from /var/www/html/redmine --> /usr/share/redmine , which did not work, mb it was a chown thing or whatever. but eventually,
  i just copied the whole /usr/share/redmine directory into /var/www/html, and started the thin server with   "thin start -C /etc/thin2.3/redmine.yml"... then lsof -i :5000 worked etc.

2. redmine: (choose to install it with the common-db installation, waaay better, and remember that mysql has a crazy password policy with numbers, 
	and specialcharacters) And if it fucks up, with half installation something, use "man dpkg" to check out the options to remove the packages,	etc.
3. redmine-mysql:(not much to say)
4. redmine + nginx:http://www.mueller-public.de/2014/06/install-redmine-on-nginxthin-guide/
