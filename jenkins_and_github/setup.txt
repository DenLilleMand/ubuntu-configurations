Best tutorial ever:  https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/article/trigger-jenkins-builds-pushing-github 

This helped(Have to add the jenkins(github plugin) integration/service on github, and as a 
jenkins hook url, use  http://<jenins_url>.com/github-webhook/  eg.

http://jenkins.codeandcocaine.com/github-webhook/

Cannot leave out the trailing slash at the end either for some reason.
Got it from:

I made a github user aswell on the jenkins server, but i think thats only for private github repositories thats nessecery.

What is very important aswell, is in the initial tutorial, that my jenkins user on the server, had a public/private rsa(ssh) keys,
and i added those as a Deploy key inside of  repository-->settings-->Deploy keys on the repository i wanted jenkins to have access to.

Jenkins ssh keys was inside of  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh ... and i think if they dont exist we can just create them. or google it or whatever.

Another important thing is, as the tutorial says, where it says github project url, https link is fine, but in the git plugin repository link,
its obviously important to use the SSH "clone" instead of https like so:


Jenkins
    -esportshub_webserver
        -GitHub project	
            -Project url:	https://github.com/DenLilleMand/esportshubwebserver/


        -Source Code management
            -Radiobutton(git) 
                -Repository Url: git@github.com:DenLilleMand/esportshubwebserver.git
And i dont need the credentials aparently.


Inside of build triggers the only thing i need tohave is "Build when a change is pushed to github"
and it gives me a warning even though it works fine atm, not sure why.
