To make the links i require to backup these files properly, instead of just uploading a file with the link inside(symbolic link),
just do a "man ln" to read more, but otherwise its hard links by default when using ln, so e.g. 

ln /home/denlillemand/.i3/config /home/denlillemand/Documents/ubuntu_configurations/i3/     Is cool.
