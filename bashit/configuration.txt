Found this, similar to  oh-my-zsh  just for bash.

https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it

It has a lot of sensible things for bash, like autocomplete, themes, aliases etc.

It is one way to get powerline in the terminal, at first mine didn't work because i had some things 
in my .bashrc file, so to just make sure that the fonts work(Using hack right now, remember to install their *.ttf files) go backup the .bashrc file. let bashit create a new one(it also has a cli), and set the following values(if bashit hasn't done this allready):

# Path to the bash it configuration
export BASH_IT="/home/denlillemand/.bash_it"

# Lock and Load a custom theme file
# location /.bash_it/themes/
export BASH_IT_THEME='powerline'

# (Advanced): Change this to the name of your remote repo if you
# cloned bash-it with a remote other than origin such as `bash-it`.
# export BASH_IT_REMOTE='bash-it'

# Your place for hosting Git repos. I use this for private repos.
export GIT_HOSTING='git@git.domain.com'

# Don't check mail when opening terminal.
unset MAILCHECK

# Change this to your console based IRC client of choice.
export IRC_CLIENT='irssi'

# Set this to the command you use for todo.txt-cli
export TODO="t"

# Set this to false to turn off version control status checking within the prompt for all themes
export SCM_CHECK=true

# Set Xterm/screen/Tmux title with only a short hostname.
# Uncomment this (or set SHORT_HOSTNAME to something else),
# Will otherwise fall back on $HOSTNAME.
#export SHORT_HOSTNAME=$(hostname -s)

# Set vcprompt executable path for scm advance info in prompt (demula theme)
# https://github.com/djl/vcprompt
#export VCPROMPT_EXECUTABLE=~/.vcprompt/bin/vcprompt

# (Advanced): Uncomment this to make Bash-it reload itself automatically
# after enabling or disabling aliases, plugins, and completions.
# export BASH_IT_AUTOMATIC_RELOAD_AFTER_CONFIG_CHANGE=1

# Load Bash It
source $BASH_IT/bash_it.sh

Notice that .bash_it  is just a directory i created, and clone bashit into.
