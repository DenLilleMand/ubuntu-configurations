Sudo apt-get install lxappearence

Open lxappearence and Pick Raleigh or whatever, and change the font to Hack,
this should change the fonts inside of ~/.gtkrc-2.0 and ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

For some of these i3 things to work properly we have to install fontawesome aswell, e.g. for the icons in the status bar.


Arc theme:

https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-Theme

After the theme is installed, go into lxappearence(if not installed install this aswell) and pick the arc theme

Other icons for ubuntu: Faba-Mono-Dark (just search for it, find its homepage or github or whatever, and it will have some install instructions), then use lxappearence --> Icon Theme to enable it.

Then we need to find a dmenu replacement, currently i am using Rofi, its basically just sudo apt-get install rofi, and then inside of the ~/.i3/config exchange the dmenu exec with rofi, and give it good cmd line arguments to customize it.

We also need Compton in order to get transparency for the Rofi window, compton should be executed in the .i3/config every time we start aswell. 

I got a lot of my i3 configuration from the repository https://github.com/bookercodes/setupi3 

Both the i3blocks configuration and the standard config.

I got a lot of tips from the youtube videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf   aswell
